**CodingMarin/codingmarin** is a โจ _special_ โจ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I started as a data engineer due to my Mathematics background, and then concentrated on web development, working for small and medium-sized companies. Lately, I have been working in international SCRUM teams and mentoring others.
